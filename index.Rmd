## OBS Studio

.pull-left[
- Cross platform streaming and video production application
- Slightly intimidating at first
- Can be as simple or complex setup as you like
- Immense flexibility via plugins (much like R packages)
- Scenes are like a list object (nested scenes)
- Automation and integrations possible with open APIs

# The Building Blocks of OBS

--

.pull-left[
  ## Sources

  * Individual components to be captured or displayed in your production
  * Examples: Camera, audio inputs, screen capture, window capture, media files, and much more

]

.pull-right[
  ## Scenes

  * A collection of one or more sources
  * Ability to show/hide sources as needed
  * No (theoritical) limitation on the number of sources inside a scene
]

--

### How to effectively organize your OBS setup?

---

# The connections with R

### __Sources__ = __(Specialized) Vectors__: A special type of object that may have its own custom attributes and specialties.

### __Scenes__ = __Lists__: A container of objects, including (potentially) other scenes/lists!

## OBS Parallels to `r icon_style(fontawesome("r-project"), fill = "blue")`

+ Base install has a lot of built-in features already to get you started
+ plugins can enhance your experience developing and serving streams, much like community packages in R
+ Organizing the building blocks of your setup with scenes, which contains sources and can even contain more scenes. This is like the list object in R

---

## Tips for using OBS

* Audio devices in dedicated scenes
* Back up your settings regularly
* Always do test recordings whenever you change levels or scene layouts
* unload images and other media sources when not using their associated scenes
* If streaming to YouTube, take advantage of doing an unlisted stream so you can mimic what it will be like for the real thing
* Lock sources when finished placing them, so you don't accidently move them
* If doing both streaming and recording, highly recommended to use a graphics card to offload encoding (I use an NVidia card in my streaming computer)

## VOD Ninja

* Uses webRTC and works well with Chrome-based browsers
* No additional software required
* Customize options via query parameters in the URL
* I use it with my shiny dev series interviews

### TODO: Add screenshot

---

## Podcast hosting

* I have overall good experience with Fireside
* Other options exist

---

## Video hosting/streaming

* The major players are Twitch and YouTube
* Emerging platforms that are decentralized: PeerTube
* A vibrant and growing community of R and data science streamers seems to be happening more on Twitch these days
